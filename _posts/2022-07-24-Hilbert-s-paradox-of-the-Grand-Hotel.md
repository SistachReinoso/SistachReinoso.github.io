How intuitive is the concept of infinity?
What means $$ \infty $$?

- Hotel with an infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied.
- Can we accommodate any newly guests?

# Finitely many new guests (i.e. $$ \infty \stackrel{?}{=} \infty + K $$, where $$ K \in \mathbb{N}^+ $$)
- New $$K$$ guests, where $$ K \in \mathbb{N}^+ $$

## Solution
If the guests of hotel move $$K$$ rooms forward, we have space for new guests.
